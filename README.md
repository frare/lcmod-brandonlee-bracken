### a Lethal Company mod made for my friends

#### Available at: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/frare/BrandonLeeBracken/

This mod changes the Bracken (Flowerman) enemy in Lethal Company to use audio files from a friend of mine; and change its mesh to a sprite of Jackie Chan, an inside joke in my group of friends.

<i>Requires LCSoundTool as a dependency!</i>

  - no00ob for providing the LCSoundTool mod, allowing easy substitution of the game's audio clips.
  - My dear friend Brandon Lee for helping me create this and having fun along with it!
